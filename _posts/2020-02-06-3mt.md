Here's my attempt at explaining my research in three minutes. It's anchored to the story of Jean-Dominuque Bauby, editor-in-chief of French Vogue, who was left in a locked-in state after suffering a severe stroke. He described his exerpeince in his 1997 memoir [The Divingbell and the Butterfly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193755.The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly).

I haven't watched this, and wont. For all I know the sound cuts out after 5 seconds. All I know is it was at least good enough to get a place in the final.
