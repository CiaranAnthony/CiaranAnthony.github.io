Hi, I'm Ciaran, a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Glasgow, supervised by [Aleksandra Vuckovic](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/aleksandravuckovic/). I graduated from the University of Glasgow in 2018 with an MEng degree in Biomedical Engineering.

You can find out more about my background in my [CV](/images/pdf/Ciaran_CV.pdf).

My research is mostly focussed on brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, a type of communication technology that allows people to interact with computers without moving their body. This can be useful in a medical context as patients with neurological impairments may use a BCI to better interact their environment, or even recover lost movements by engaging in BCI training. 

As of February 2020, I'm recruiting individuals with persistent arm weakness (e.g. stroke patients) for a BCI [study](_posts/2020-02-01-stroke-study.md) investigating bimanual motor imagery: [flyer](/images/blog/strokeStudy/flyer.pdf).

I will soon collaborate with [Monzurul Alam](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/bme/people/academic-staff/dr-monzurul-alam/) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic Univeristiy on a clinical study exploring the potential of BCI motor priming for transcutaneous electical stimulation therapy in spinal-cord injury patients.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project, or would like access to bimanual motor imagery data, do get in [touch](c.mcgeady.1@research.gla.ac.uk).

Here is a list of the software that I generally use 

> **Programming** Python, Matlab, etc. <br>
> **Editor** VS Code <br>
> **Others** LaTeX <br>

And hardware

> **EEG acquisition** USBamp (gtec, Austria), OpenBCI
