Hi, I'm Ciaran, a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Glasgow, supervised by [Aleksandra Vuckovic](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/aleksandravuckovic/). I graduated from the University of Glasgow in 2018 with an MEng degree in Biomedical Engineering. I wrote my Master's thesis based on research conducted at the Technical University of Denmark.

You can find out more info about me in my [CV](/images/pdf/Ciaran_CV.pdf)

My research explores new methods for interacting with brain-computer interfaces (BCI) with motor imagery. 

Currently recruiting stroke patients with persistent arm weakness for an online BCI study: [flyer](/images/blog/strokeStudy/flyer.pdf).

I will soon collaborate with [Monzurul Alam](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/bme/people/academic-staff/dr-monzurul-alam/) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic Univeristiy on a clinical study exploring the potential of BCI motor priming on trans-spinal electical stimulation therapy in spinal-cord injury patients.

Here is a list of the software that I generally use

> **Programming** Python, Matlab, etc. <br>
> **Editor** Visual Studio Code <br>
> **Others** LaTeX <br>
