<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Ciaran, a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Glasgow, supervised by <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/aleksandravuckovic/">Aleksandra Vuckovic</a>. I graduated from the University of Glasgow in 2018 with an MEng degree in Biomedical Engineering.</p>

<p>You can find out more about my background in my <a href="/images/pdf/Ciaran_CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

<p>My research is mostly focussed on brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, a type of communication technology that allows people to interact with computers without moving their body. They can be useful in a medical context as paralysed patients can use a BCI to better control their environment, or even improve their condition with BCI rehabilitation therapy.</p>

<p>As of February 2020, Iâ€™m recruiting individuals with persistent arm weakness (e.g. stroke patients) for a BCI <a href="_posts/2020-02-01-stroke-study.md">study</a> investigating bimanual motor imagery: <a href="/images/blog/strokeStudy/flyer.pdf">flyer</a>.</p>

<p>I will soon collaborate with <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/bme/people/academic-staff/dr-monzurul-alam/">Monzurul Alam</a> at the Hong Kong Polytechnic Univeristiy on a clinical study exploring the potential of BCI motor priming for transcutaneous electical stimulation therapy in spinal-cord injury patients.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on a project, discussing research, or would like access to my bimanual motor imagery dataset, do get in <a href="mailto:c.mcgeady.1@research.gla.ac.uk">touch</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the software that I generally use</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Programming</strong> Python, Matlab, etc. <br />
<strong>Editor</strong> VS Code <br />
<strong>Others</strong> LaTeX <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And hardware</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>EEG acquisition</strong> USBamp (gtec, Austria), OpenBCI</p>
