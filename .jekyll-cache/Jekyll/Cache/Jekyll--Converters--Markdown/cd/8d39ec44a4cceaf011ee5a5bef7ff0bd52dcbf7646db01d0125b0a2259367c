<p>I’m Ciaran, a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Glasgow, supervised by <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/aleksandravuckovic/">Aleksandra Vuckovic</a>. I graduated from the University of Glasgow in 2018 with an MEng degree in Biomedical Engineering. I wrote my Master’s thesis based on research conducted at the Technical University of Denmark.</p>

<p>You can find out more info about me in my <a href="/images/pdf/Ciaran_CV.pdf">CV</a></p>

<p>My research explores new methods for interacting with brain-computer interfaces (BCI) with motor imagery.</p>

<p>Currently recruiting stroke patients with persistent arm weakness for an online BCI study: <a href="/images/blog/strokeStudy/flyer.pdf">flyer</a>.</p>

<p>I will soon collaborate with <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/bme/people/academic-staff/dr-monzurul-alam/">Monzurul Alam</a> at the Hong Kong Polytechnic Univeristiy on a clinical study exploring the potential of BCI motor priming on trans-spinal electical stimulation therapy in spinal-cord injury patients.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the software that I generally use</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Programming</strong> Python, Matlab, etc. <br />
<strong>Editor</strong> Visual Studio Code <br />
<strong>Others</strong> LaTeX <br /></p>
